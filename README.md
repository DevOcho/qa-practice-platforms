# QA Practice Platforms
This repository contains multiple small pieces of software designed
for QA students to learn how to test (both manual and automated tests).

These are not intended to be used for any purpose other than testing.  In
some cases we've created specific bugs in the software for the student to find.

## Quick Start

In order to launch the platform you can use `docker compose`

```
git clone git@github.com:DevOcho/qa-practice-platforms.git
cd qa-practice-platforms
docker compose up
```

These will start numerous small web applications on your computer as well as a
MariaDB database server.  These are intended for use with the DevOcho training
material (training.devocho.com).
